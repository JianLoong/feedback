# jianloong/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. This is a fork of holman/feedback.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're still better off
if you [ask GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.
